# Rapido Framework

An easy and quick [**Sass**](http://sass-lang.com/) + [**Compass**](http://compass-style.org/) + [**Susy**](http://susy.oddbird.net/) + [**OOCSS**](http://oocss.org/) + [**BEM**](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) prototyping framework based on Bootstrap without all the default styles.

## Features

* Most of the modules from Boostrap (some heavily modified and streamlined)
* **CSS architecture and styling completely separated**, creating and switching complex themes is much easier
* **Every unused component can be disabled** to slim the final css
* All sizes are in **em** and respect the **vertical rhythm** of the page
* **Super easy responsive layouts** with Susy and custom mixins
* Full support of **automatic sprite generation** (with Compass)
* Full support of **icon fonts** with 8 fonts already included and custom mixin to remove any frictions
* Complete set of **css animations** with custom mixin
* There is a variable for almost everything
